# Summary

## One drawback 

- Select Options displayed: A misspelled search can generate a wrong search. Having selecting options for city, state and country would reduce the possibilities of mispelling words and wrong results from the users. For example: the city "grant pass" will not display any row but "grants pass" will display at least one. 

## Additional recommendations for further development

- Sort by column: A basic functionality that every table have is a sort by column, always useful if the dataset contains similar results by column. 
- Pagination: If the dataset is more that 50 rows it would be always useful to have a pagination functionality.
